# UO-PopEcol
 This repository contains the materials for the computer lab component of the University of Oregon's Population Ecology class. The class covers core concepts across the field of Population Ecology (principally in the lecture component of the class) and exercises these concepts with the worksheets contained in this repository. The lab component of this class also introduces important tools used by practicing population ecologists that span analytical, simulation-based, and statistical methods. This lab also culminates in a final project in which students implement these tools to explore some ecological or applied question of their choosing. A loose breakdown of topics covered, organized by worksheet, is as follows:
 
 - Worksheet 1: Introduction to R
 - Worksheet 2: Density-dependence and an Introduction to Stability
 - Worksheet 3: Structured Population and an Introduction to Sensitivity
 - Worksheet 4: Predator-Prey Models, Disease Dynamics, and More Stability
 - Worksheet 5: Annual Plant Competition and Parameter Estimation
 - Worksheet 6: Misc. Topics

I have used many resources to guide the development of these course materials. Most notably: 
- Hank Steven's [Primer of Ecology Using R](https://hankstevens.github.io/Primer-of-Ecology/index.html)
- Sarah Otto and Troy Day's [A Biologist's Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/biomath/)
- Stefano Allesina's [materials on Theoretical Community Ecology](https://stefanoallesina.github.io/Theoretical_Community_Ecology/)
